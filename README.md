# 📚 Libft Project

Hey there! Welcome to my Libft project. This was my first adventure at 42 School, and it was quite a ride! 🚀

## What's this all about?
Imagine being told you can't use any standard C functions... you have to build them yourself! That's exactly what this project is about. I had to recreate many standard C library functions from scratch, building my own set of functions that I'll be using throughout my 42 journey.

## How did I tackle it?
I broke down the project into manageable chunks:
- Started with the basic stuff (string manipulation, memory management)
- Moved on to the trickier functions (linked lists, anyone?)
- Wrapped it all up in a neat library called `libft.a`

The catch? I could only use `write`, `malloc`, and `free`. Everything else had to be built from the ground up!

## Challenges? Oh boy...
-🧠 Getting my head around pointer arithmetic
-🐛 Hunting down those sneaky memory leaks
-⚡ Making functions both efficient and reliable
-🎯 Matching the exact behavior of the original functions

## What I learned
This project was like a coding boot camp! I now have:
- A solid grasp on memory management in C
- Better debugging skills (you need them when building from scratch!)
- A deeper understanding of how standard functions actually work
- More confidence in writing clean, efficient code

This project might seem simple on the surface, but it taught me that understanding the basics is crucial for becoming a better programmer. Now I've got a reliable set of tools that I built myself - and that's pretty cool! 😎
